"""Tests for the trash action: recoverable removal via the server's Trash/Bin.

`trash_email` resolves the Trash folder (SPECIAL-USE ``\\Trash`` first, then
common Bin/Trash names) and moves the message there, which is the removal
path that actually works on Gmail. A message already in the Trash is expunged
in place; a server with no resolvable Trash raises rather than silently
expunging.
