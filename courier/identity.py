"""Identity resolution: which From identity to use, and which SMTP route it takes.

Resolution rules are documented in examples/config.sample.toml. This module
turns a parsed ``CourierConfig`` plus context (an explicit From, a parent
email being replied to, etc.) into the concrete ``Identity`` and
``SmtpConfig`` that the SMTP transport will use.

Three failure modes are exposed as exceptions so the CLI can convert them
into clean exit-1 errors rather than tracebacks:

    SendDisabled: the selected [imap.NAME] block has no [identity.*] block
        pointing at it. The block is read-only for sending; an
        [identity.NAME] block must be added to enable sends.
    IdentityNotFound: the explicit From address does not match any
        identity configured for the selected [imap.NAME] block.
    SmtpUnresolved: the resolved identity has no SMTP route (no
        identity.smtp, no imap_block.default_smtp, and not a single
        ``[smtp.*]`` block to fall back to).
