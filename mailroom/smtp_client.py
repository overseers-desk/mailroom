    When *original_email* is None the function produces a fresh email with the
    given *to* / *subject* / *body*. When it is provided the function produces
    a reply: threading headers (``In-Reply-To``, ``References``) are added, the
    subject is prefixed with ``"Re: "`` if needed, and the original body is
    quoted under an attribution line. The primary recipient list follows
    RFC 5322 §3.6.2: the parent's ``Reply-To`` is used when present, otherwise
    the parent's ``From``. *reply_all* extends recipients to include the
    original To/Cc (minus the sender); when ``Reply-To`` diverts the primary
    list, the original ``From`` is added to Cc so the original sender still
    sees the reply-all.

    Args:
        from_addr: Address that appears in the ``From`` header.
        body: Plain-text body.
        to: Recipients (required when *original_email* is None).
        subject: Subject (required when *original_email* is None; optional for
            replies — defaults to the original subject with ``"Re: "`` prefix).
        cc: CC recipients. For replies with *reply_all*, defaults to the
            original email's Cc list.
        bcc: BCC recipients. Written to the ``Bcc`` header; most sending agents
            strip it before transmission.
        html_body: Optional HTML body. Triggers a ``multipart/alternative``
            child inside ``multipart/mixed``. Three values are
            distinguished: ``None`` (default) auto-renders an HTML
            alternative if *body* contains a markdown table or heading,
            else sends text/plain only; ``""`` forces text/plain only
            even when triggers are present (caller has considered HTML
            and chose none); any other string is used verbatim and the
            auto-render path is not invoked.
        attachments: Optional list of filesystem paths to attach. Duplicate
            basenames are accepted but may confuse some clients on save.
        original_email: If given, produce a reply to this message.
        reply_all: Reply-only. Include original To/Cc in recipients.

    Returns:
        An ``EmailMessage`` (plain text, no attachments) or ``MIMEMultipart``
        (otherwise), ready to serialise with ``.as_bytes()``.
