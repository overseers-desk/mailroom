name: mailroom
description: Search, read, and look up information from the user's IMAP mailboxes via the mailroom CLI, and send mail when asked. Trigger when the user asks to find or look something up in their email, recall what someone has said in mail, summarise correspondence with a person, search the inbox for a topic, or check replies. Phrases like "tell me about X from emails", "what did X email me about", "find Y in my mail", "search my inbox for Z", or "show recent messages from W" all route here. Use this rather than guessing an email address from a name.

# Email workflow via mailroom

## Process

0. Note today's date, whether a reply, and if so the delay.
1. Show from / identity, to, cc, bcc, subject, body for review.
2. Wait for user approval.
3. Send via `mailroom`.
4. Report `message_id_sent` from the JSON output.

Do not save a draft if told to send.

## One-shot principle

Each mailroom invocation is the final call — no pre-flight `list`, `config-check`, or `folders` before a send the user already approved. If the command needs context (which identity, which folder), ask the user, not mailroom. mailroom errors name the exact corrective flag; a wrong invocation self-corrects without a probe phase.

Skip `mailroom config-check` unless the user reports config-related trouble. Skip `mailroom list` unless the user explicitly asks "what identities do I have".

## Sending: pick a route

`compose --send`, `reply --send`, and `send-draft` all require an explicit route. Two forms:

- **Mode A (preferred when the user names an identity)**: `--identity NAME` resolves From address, display name, IMAP block, SMTP block, and sent_folder from the configured `[identity.NAME]` block. One flag, no other identity-related flags valid.
- **Mode B (relay-style sends without a configured identity)**: `--smtp NAME --from EMAIL [--name "Display Name"] [--fcc IMAP_NAME:FOLDER]`. The named `[smtp.NAME]` block must carry its own username/password. Use this for SES-style relays authorised to carry many addresses.

If the user names an identity ("send as partnerships"), use `--identity partnerships` directly. If the user gives only an address, ask whether they have an `[identity.NAME]` for it before falling back to mode B.

## Cowardly refusal: --allow-no-copy

mailroom refuses to send when no copy will be retained. A copy is retained iff FCC will run, OR the BCC list includes the sender's own address. A BCC addressed only to a third party (e.g. an auditor) does not count. Pass `--allow-no-copy` only when the user explicitly opts into a no-record send (e.g. throwaway sends through a relay that archives independently).

## Identity-level bcc (send-only identities)

`[identity.NAME]` may declare a `bcc = "self@x"` (string or list). On every send from this identity, those addresses are appended to BCC automatically. When `bcc` is set, the identity may omit `imap` entirely — send-only, self-BCC substitutes for FCC. Such identities cannot fetch, save drafts, or reply to a parent; they only do `compose --send`.

## New emails

```bash
mailroom compose \
  --to recipient@example.com \
  --subject "..." \
  --body "..." \
  --send --identity NAME
```

HTML: add `--body-html "<p>...</p>"`; both `--body` and `--body-html` → `multipart/alternative`. `--attach <path>` and `--bcc <addr>` are repeatable.

JSON output includes `message_id_sent` (recipient-visible Message-ID; differs from `message_id_local` when the smarthost rewrites it, e.g. SES) and `accepted_recipients`.

## Replies

```bash
mailroom -i <imap> reply -f <folder> -u <uid> --body "..." --send --identity NAME
```

Without `--identity`, mailroom matches the parent's recipients against the imap block's identities and uses the matching one. A miss errors rather than guessing. Threading headers set from parent automatically. `--reply-all`, `--cc`, `--body-html`, `--bcc`, `--attach` work the same as on `compose`. Drop `--send` to save a draft instead.

## Sending an existing draft

```bash
mailroom -i <imap> send-draft -f Drafts -u <uid>
```

Reads draft, matches From to an imap identity, transmits, removes on success. `--keep-draft` retains it. `--dry-run` authenticates without sending. `--bcc` adds envelope-time recipients without rewriting the draft body. `--identity NAME` overrides the draft's From; `--smtp NAME --from EMAIL` is mode B.

## Top-level flags

- `-i, --imap NAME`: select a configured `[imap.NAME]` block. Omit to use `default_imap`. Repeat with `search` to query multiple blocks.
- `-A, --all-imap`: query every imap block (search only).
- `-c, --config PATH`: alternate config file.

Migration: `-a <account>` → `-i <imap>`; `[[identities]]` → `[identity.NAME]`.

## After a successful send

mailroom FCCs wire-form bytes to the Sent folder with `Bcc:` stripped and `Message-ID:` rewritten to the recipient-visible form (threading depends on this match). Configure Sent folder per identity via `sent_folder = "..."`; without it, mailroom auto-detects via SPECIAL-USE `\Sent` and falls back to `Sent`. When the SMTP block has `save_sent = false` (or `"auto"` resolving to false on Gmail, where the server auto-files), the FCC step is skipped.

## Looking up a person by name

Search by name, not a constructed address. AI-guessed addresses (e.g. `alicedoe@gmail.com`) commonly miss; real addresses have no surface relation to the name. Issue a name-based query first, read a hit to learn the real address, then narrow.

## Lookups

Look up several keywords in one go by repeating the verb:

```bash
mailroom -A search "sergio" search "panedas" search "sergiopanedas"
```

Each keyword sits under its own outer key in the result, so a message comes labelled with the keyword that matched it. Output is JSON of shape `{op_key: {imap_name: {results: [...], provenance: {...}}}}`. With `[local_cache]` configured the queries run against a local index orders of magnitude faster than IMAP; without it queries hit IMAP directly. Each per-term response carries a `provenance` field reporting `source` (`"local"` or `"remote"`) and any fall-back reason.

A term may itself be an OR clause: `mailroom -A search "from:@csair.com OR 'China Southern'" search "renfe"`. Each term still costs one server query and keeps its own result key. A bare `from:alice OR from:bob` with no chained terms returns one flat union with no per-key attribution.

`mailroom -A` queries every imap block; `-i NAME` (repeatable) selects specific blocks. Verbs mix freely: `mailroom search foo read -f INBOX -u 42` runs the search and the fetch over one connection per block.

Read, list and extract attachments, or export the verbatim `.eml` for a hit:

```bash
mailroom -i <imap> read -f <folder> -u <uid>
mailroom -i <imap> attachments -f <folder> -u <uid>
mailroom -i <imap> save -f <folder> -u <uid> -i <name> -o <path>
mailroom -i <imap> export -f <folder> -u <uid> --raw -o /tmp/msg.eml
```

`mailroom list` enumerates configured blocks/identities/SMTP. Run it only when the user explicitly asks.
